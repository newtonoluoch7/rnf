                                <p class="about-text">Reinhard Nyabinda Foundation was formed for the benefit of the people. It’s mission outlines three objectives: Promote Education, Alleviate poverty through economic empowerment, helping the distressed and ultimately provide for the needy and lastly promoting sporting activities. 
                                    Also a responsibility for the Foundation is actualizing the desire and dreams of Reinhard Bonnke Nyabinda through charitable activities, 
                                    mentorships, and talent nurturing.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>In keeping with the vision of Reinhard B. Nyabinda, the Foundation puts great importance on education and economic empowerment. Through initiatives such as scholarships for the needy students, provision of reading materials to the needy students as well as support of many kinds including but not limited to girls' hygiene during menses to ensure their education cycle is not altered with. We at RNF consider that this permanent yet noble gesture will have a great contribution in the field of education and in the Kenyan history for the benefit of both present and future generations.
                                    The scholarship project is one that the Foundation prides itself of. The scholarships are provided to people in need of it. Though the process of selection is based on meritocracy, emphasis is given to secondary education. This aims at supporting one hundred percent transition agenda promoted by the Government through the Ministry of Education from primary to secondary school and sustaining the same. Further, the project seeks to cushion underprivileged students whose families cannot raise school fees to support their secondary education which is very key in the Kenyan education system.
                                    The importance placed on education is very obvious; it is the backbone of every society. Similarly, it is the key to success to many if not all children especially those from underprivileged backgrounds. It is education that turns the wheels in the society. With such a project, therefore, the most deserving children with financial constraints get the opportunity to further their education thereby realizing their dreams and full potential ultimately changing lives.
                                    
                                     </p>
                                <p>RNF is always looking for volunteers to aid in the running of projects. Volunteering at Reinhard Nyabinda Foundation is a totally 
                                    different experience. Volunteering simply includes spreading awareness of the reputable organization and its mission. By doing so, people are aware of the modest Foundation, and may offer their support for the cause. One can also share information about charitable-minded people who are willing, able and ready to freely contribute their time and
                                     resources into achieving the Foundation's goals, and ultimately make the country and the  world at large a better place.</p>

                                <p>RNF’s programs are targeted to high school students in Kenya. We partner with educational institutions and religious institutions to identify the most deserving students develop and nurture seeds of talent and education excellence in young Kenyans for better future leaders. 
                                    The Foundation pays special attention to vulnerable groups such as orphans, children living with disability, the poor and marginalized communities. Since child development does not occur in a vacuum, we will also work with teachers, parents and guardians to ensure that children grow up in an environment that encourages growth of their talents and education prowess.</p>
                                    <p>Similarly, under the Economic empowerment segment RNF targets Women groups, organized Youth groups and SMEs in marginalized areas as well us informal settlements for proper support for them to thrive. The Foundation shall endeavor to initiate flagship projects and training for these groups to ensure that they are well equipped with current and modern ways of doing and running their ventures for sustainable growth.
                                    Young boys and girls with special talents in various sporting activities shall have a special place within the foundation. RNF shall ensure that such persons are identified at a tender age and given special attention with a view to promoting and nurturing the said talents which may in turn be a source of livelihood for them in the future.
